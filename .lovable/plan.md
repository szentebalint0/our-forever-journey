## 1. Navigation Ribbon
A sleek, fixed top navigation bar with smooth scroll anchors:
- **Notes** → Reasons why I love you section

## 2. Opening Section with Live Counter
A full-screen opening area with floating heart animations and a **live relationship counter** showing years, months, days, hours, minutes, and seconds since **February 11, 2023**.

Headline: *"The time since you said yes"* — counter updates every second.

Counter digits sized and spaced perfectly for the 393px iPhone 16 width. Romantic rose/pink gradient background.

## 3. "Reasons Why I Love You" Section
A grid of flashcard-style boxes (6-8 cards) with placeholder text you can edit.

On iPhone 16: **single column layout** so each card gets full width and is easy to read. Subtle hover/tap lift effect with heart icons.

Images sized to fill the 393px width beautifully. A `src/assets/photos/` folder with placeholder images you can swap with your own.

A large tappable heart button. When tapped, a love letter fades in with a styled "handwritten" look and placeholder text you can customize.

Button and letter sized generously for comfortable mobile interaction.
